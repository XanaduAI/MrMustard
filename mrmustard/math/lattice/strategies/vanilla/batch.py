    r"""Batched version of the vanilla algorithm for calculating the fock representation of a
    Gaussian tensor. This implementation assumes that the batch dimension is on the first
    axis of A, b, and c and it's the same for all of them.
    It can use either the standard or the stable algorithm based on the `stable` flag.
    Default is to use the standard algorithm.
    See the documentation of ``vanilla_numba`` and ``stable_numba`` for more details.

    Args:
        shape (tuple[int, ...]): shape of the output tensor excluding the batch dimension
        A (np.ndarray): batched A matrix of the Bargmann representation
        b (np.ndarray): batched b vector of the Bargmann representation
        c (complex): batched vacuum amplitudes
        stable (bool): if ``True``, use the stable algorithm, otherwise use the standard one
        out (np.ndarray): if provided, the result will be stored in this tensor.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Fock representation of the Gaussian tensor with shape ``(batch,) + shape``
