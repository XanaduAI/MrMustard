    r"""Vanilla algorithm for calculating the fock representation of a Gaussian tensor.
    This implementation works on flattened tensors and reshapes the tensor before returning.

    The vanilla algorithm implements the flattened version of the following recursion which
    calculates the Fock amplitude at index :math:`k` using a pivot at index :math:`k - 1_i`
    and its neighbours at indices :math:`k - 1_i - 1_j`:

    .. math::

         G_{k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k_i}} \left[b_{i} G_{k-1_i} + \sum_j A_{ij} \sqrt{k_j - \delta_{ij}} G_{k-1_i-1_j} \right]

    where :math:`1_i` is the vector of zeros with a 1 at index :math:`i`, and :math:`\delta_{ij}` is the Kronecker delta.
    In this formula :math:`k` is the vector of indices indexing into the Fock lattice.
    In the implementation the indices are flattened into a single integer index.
    This simplifies the bounds check when calculating the index of the pivot :math:`k-1_i`,
    which need to be done only until the index is smaller than the maximum stride.
