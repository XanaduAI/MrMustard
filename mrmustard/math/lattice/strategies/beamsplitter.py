# Recurrencies for Fock-Bargmann amplitudes put together a strategy for
# enumerating the indices in a specific order and functions for calculating
# which neighbours to use in the calculation of the amplitude at a given index.
# In summary, they return the value of the amplitude at the given index by following
# a recipe made of two parts. The function to recompute A and b is determined by
# which neighbours are used.
