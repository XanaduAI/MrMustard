# Recurrencies for Fock-Bargmann amplitudes put together a strategy for
# enumerating the indices in a specific order and functions for calculating
# which neighbours to use in the calculation of the amplitude at a given index.
# In summary, they return the value of the amplitude at the given index by following
# a recipe made of two parts. The function to recompute A and b is determined by
# which neighbours are used.

def beamsplitter_schwinger(shape, theta, phi, max_N=None):
    r"""Returns the Fock representation of the beamsplitter up to
    the given cutoff for each of the two modes.

    This implementation is in pure python (so it's slower than the numba version),
    but it's numerically stable up to arbitrary cutoffs.

    In this implementation we split the two-mode Fock basis into finite subsets spanned
    by |m,n> with m+n=const, i.e. {|0,0>}, {|1,0>,|0,1>}, {|2,0>, |1,1>, |0,2>}, etc...
    A beamsplitter acts unitariliy in each of these subspaces without mixing them with each other,
    i.e. in this basis the beamsplitter would be a block-diagonal matrix.
    This means we can construct the BS matrix by first calculating the BS unitaries
    in each of these subspaces.
    This can be done using the matrix exponential, which is numerically stable.
    We couldn't do this in the original basis because it was infinite-dimensional
    and we had to truncate it at some point.

    Arguments:
        shape (int, int, int, int): The shape of the output tensor. Only shapes of the form (i,k,i,k) are supported.
