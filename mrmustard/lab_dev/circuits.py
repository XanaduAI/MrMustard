class Circuit:
    r"""
    A quantum circuit. It is a sequence of uncontracted components, which leaves the
    possibility of contracting them in different orders. The order in which the components
    are contracted is specified by the ``path`` attribute.

    Different orders of contraction lead to the same result, but the cost of the contraction
    can vary significantly. The ``path`` attribute is used to specify the order in which the
    components are contracted.
