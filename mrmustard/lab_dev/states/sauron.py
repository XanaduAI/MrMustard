    r"""
    The `n`-th Sauron state is an approximation of the `n`-th Fock states using
    a ring of `n+1` coherent states. The reference to the Lord of the Rings comes from
    the approximation becoming perfect in the limit for the radius of the ring going
    to zero where vacuum (= darkness) is.
    The formula for the Sauron state as a superposition of coherent states on a ring
    is given in https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17099:
    .. math::
        |\text{Sauron}(n)\rangle = \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{n} e^{i 2\pi k/(n+1)} |\epsilon e^{2\pi k/(n+1)}\rangle_c,
    Args:
        modes: The modes of the Sauron state.
        n: The Fock state that is approximated.
        epsilon: The radius of the ring of coherent states, default is 0.1.
