    .. details::
        For a function f defined on the complex domain, we can define the following Complex Fourier Transform (aka symplectic Fourier Transform):
        .. math::
            \hat f(\zeta) = \int f(z) \exp(z \bar{\zeta} - \bar{z} \zeta)
        this formulation can be extended to multi-variables by taking the transform over many (i.e., by as many zeta variables as needed)
