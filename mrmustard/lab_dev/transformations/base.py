"""
This module contains the base classes for the available unitaries and channels on quantum states.

In the docstrings defining the available unitaries we provide a definition in terms of
the symplectic matrix :math:`S` and the real vector :math:`d`. For deterministic Gaussian channels,
we use the two matrices :math:`X` and :math:`Y` and the vector :math:`d`. Additionally, we
provide the ``(A, b, c)`` triples that define the transformation in the Fock Bargmann
representation.
