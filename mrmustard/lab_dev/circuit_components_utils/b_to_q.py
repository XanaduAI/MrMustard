    The Operation that changes the representation of an object from ``Bargmann`` into quadrature.
    By default it's defined on the output ket side. Note that beyond such gate we cannot place further
    ones unless they support inner products in quadrature representation.

    Args:
        modes: The modes of this channel.
        phi: The quadrature angle. 0 corresponds to the `x` quadrature, and :math:`\pi/2` to the `p` quadrature.
