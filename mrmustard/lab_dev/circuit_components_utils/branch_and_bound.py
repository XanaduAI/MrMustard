    def contraction_cost(self, other: GraphComponent) -> int:
        r"""
        Returns the computational cost in approx FLOPS for contracting this component with another
        one. Three cases are possible:

        1. If both components are in Fock representation the cost is the product of the values along
        both shapes, counting only once the shape of the contracted indices. E.g. a tensor with shape
        (20,30,40) contracts its 1,2 indices with the 0,1 indices of a tensor with shape (30,40,50,60).
        The cost is 20 x 30 x 40 x 50 x 60 = 72_000_000 (note 30,40 were counted only once).

        2. If the representations are a mix of Bargmann and Fock, we add the cost of converting the
        Bargmann to Fock, which is the product of the shape of the Bargmann component.

        3. If both are in Bargmann representation, the contraction can be a simple a Gaussian integral
        which scales like the cube of the number of contracted indices, i.e. ~ just 8 in the example above.

        Arguments:
