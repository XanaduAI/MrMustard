The physics module contains high-level functions for performing calculations on quantum objects.
It allows for objects in different representation to be used seamlessly in the same calculation.
E.g.`fidelity(A, B)` works whether A and B are in Fock or Gaussian representation or a mix of both.

All the functions are automatically differentiated and can be used in conjunction with an 
optimiization routine.
