r"""
The physics module contains high-level functions for performing calculations on quantum objects.
It allows for objects with different representations to be used seamlessly in the same calculation, e.g., ``fidelity(A, B)`` works whether A and B are in the Fock or Gaussian representation or a mix of both.

All the functions are automatically differentiated and can be used in conjunction with an
optimization routine.
