    The Phase noise channel.

    This class represents the application of a random phase. The distributiuon of the phase
    is assumed to be a Gaussian with mean zero, and standard deviation `phase_stdev`.

    Args:
        mode: The mode the channel is applied to.
        phase_stdev: The standard deviation of the random phase noise.
        phase_stdev_trainable: Whether ``phase_stdev`` is trainable.
        phase_stdev_bounds: The bounds for ``phase_stdev``.

        The Fock representation is connected to the Fourier coefficients of the distribution.
