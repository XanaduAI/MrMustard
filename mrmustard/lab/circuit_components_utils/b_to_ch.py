class BtoChar(Map):
    r"""
    The `s`-parametrized ``Dgate`` as a ``Map``. Also known as the Fourier transform of the Stratonovich-Weyl kernel. See https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9707010.
    This is an unphysical component whose purpose is to modify the internal representation of another component. In particular it transforms between the Bargmann representation and the s-parametrized Characteristic functions. Note that it can be applied to a subset of modes.

    Args:
        modes: The modes of this channel.
        s: The `s` parameter of this channel.

    ..details::
        This class represents the transformation from the Bargmann (B) representation
        to characteristic function (Char).

        Any operator, say O can be expressed in the displacement basis. Formally, we have that
        the s-parametrized phase space basis is characterized by the following operators

        .. math::

            D_s(\alpha) = exp(s|\alpha|^2/2) D(\alpha).
        The s-parametrized phase space representation of an object O, would therefore be

        .. math::

            mathrm{tr}(D_s(\alpha) O).

        Important s-parametrizations include:
        - s=1: returns the complex Fourier transform (or often
        called the symplectic Fourier transform) of Galuber-Sudarshan P function.

        - s=0: returns the characteristic function, which is equivalent to the complex Fourier
        transform of the Wigner function.

        - s=-1: returns the complex Fourier transform of the Q function.

        >>> from mrmustard import math

        >>> chi = (Ket.random([0]) >> BtoChar([0], s=0)).ansatz
