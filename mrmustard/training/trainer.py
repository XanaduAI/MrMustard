"""This module contains the implementation of distributed training utilities for parallelized
optimization of MrMustard circuits/devices through the function :meth:`map_trainer`.

This module requires extra dependencies, to install:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard
    cd MrMustard
    pip install -e .[ray]


User-provided Wrapper Functions
===============================
To distribute your optimization workflow, two user-defined functions are needed for wrapping up user logic:

* A `device_factory` that wraps around the logic for making your circuits/states to be optimized; it is expected to return a single, or list of, :class:`Circuit`(s).
* A `cost_fn` that takes the circuits made and additional keyword arguments and returns a backprop-able scalar cost.

Separating the circuit-making logic from the cost calculation logic has the benefit of returning the optimized circuit in the result dict for further inspection. One can also pass extra `metric_fns` to directly extract info from the circuit.


Examples:

        target = Gaussian(1) >> Dgate(-1.5, y_targ)
        s = Vacuum(1) >> circ
        return -fidelity(s, target)

    """Maps multiple training tasks across multiple workers using `ray`.

    In practice, the most common use case is to ignore the keywords `trainer` (as it defaults to
    :meth:`train_device`), `pbar`, `unblock`, etc. and just concentrate on `tasks` and `**kwargs`
    which passes arguments to the wrapper functions that contain the task execution logic, as well
    as the :class:`Optimizer` and its :meth:`Optimizer.minimize`.

    For example, with the default `trainer` :meth:`train_device`, two user-defined functions are used for wrapping up user logic:

    * A `device_factory` (optional) that wraps around the logic for making circuits/states to be optimized; it is expected to return a single, or list of, :class:`Circuit`(s).

    * A `cost_fn` (required) that takes the circuits made and additional keyword arguments and returns a backprop-able scalar cost.

    Refer to the `kwargs` section below for more available options.

    Args:
        trainer (callable): The function containing the training loop to be distributed, whose
            fixed arguments are to be passed by `**kwargs` and task-specific arguments iterated
            through `tasks`. Provide only when custom evaluation/training logic is needed.
            Defaults to :meth:`train_device`.
        tasks (Union[int, Sequence, Mapping]): Number of repeats or collection of task-specific training
            config arguments feeding into :meth:`train_device`.
            Refer to `kwargs` below for the available options.
            Defaults to 1 which runs `trainer` exactly once.
        pbar (bool): Whether to show a progress bar, available only in blocking mode (i.e. `unblock==False`). Defaults to True.
        unblock (bool): Whether to unblock the process and returns a getter function returning the available results.
            Defaults to False.
        num_cpus (int): Number of cpu workers to initialize ray. Defaults to the number of virtual cores.
        kwargs: Additional arguments containing fixed training config kwargs feeding into `trainer`.
            For the default `trainer` :meth:`train_device`, available options are:

                    list/dict of devices. If None, `cost_fn` will be assumed to take no positional argument (for
                    example, when device-making is contained in `cost_fn`). Defaults to None.
                - metric_fns (Union[Sequence[callable], Mapping[callable], callable]):
                    Optional collection of functions that takes the
                    output of `device_factory` after optimization and returns arbitrary evaluation/information.
                - return_kwargs (bool):
                    Whether to include input config `kwargs` in the output dict. Defualts to True.
                - skip_opt (bool):
                    Whether to skip the optimization and directly calculate cost.
                - tag (str):
                    Optional label of the training task associated with the `kwargs` to be included in the output dict.
                - any kwargs to `cost_fn`: exluding the output of `device_factory`.
                - any kwargs to `device_factory`: e.g. `x`, `r`, `theta`, etc.
                - any kwargs to `Optimizer`: e.g. `euclidean_lr`.
                - any kwargs to `Optimizer.minimize`: excluding `cost_fn` and `by_optimizing`, e.g. `max_steps`.

    Returns
        Union[List, Dict]: The collection of results from each training task. Returns
            - a list if `tasks` is provided as an int or a list; or
            - a dict with the same keys if `tasks` is provided as a dict.
