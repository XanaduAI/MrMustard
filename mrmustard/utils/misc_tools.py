def duck_type_checker(obj_a: object, obj_b: object) -> bool:
    r"""*If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.*

    This function performs type-checking from a duck-type perspective, testing whether both given
    objects share the same set of attributes. If they do, no matter their *type* -as obtained by
    a call to ``isinstance``-, they will be considered to be of the same duck-type.

    Note that we here look at the symmetric difference, hence the exact question we ask is better
    phrased as "*Are both objects of the same type?*" than as "*Is object a of the same type as
    object b?*".

    Note also that this checks for the exact match between types -via attributes-, this system is
    **not** meant to work with subclasses since there is a high probability that they might have
    different attributes.

    Args:
        obj_a:  one of the objects to be checked
        obj_b:  the other object to be checked

    Returns:
        True if both objects have exactly the same attributes, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If at least one of the objects given can't be compared via duck-typing, i.e.
            lack attributes. A typical example would be python basic types such as ``int``, ``float``,
            ``bool``, etc.
